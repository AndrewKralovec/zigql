# Graphql Parser Zig
A graphql parsing library written in zig.
After reading that [bun](https://bun.sh/) was coded in zig, i wanted to try it out. 

This is a toy project to see i can build a graphql parser. The continuation of this project would be then trying to implement the parser in a web server. Or even have bun interface with it to parse graphql faster for their runtime. 

This project is inspired by [apollo-rs](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs.git).
