# Graphql Parser Zig
A graphql parsing library written in zig.
After reading that [bun](https://bun.sh/) was coded in zig, i wanted to try it out. 
I decided to teach myself by making a graphql parser. 
Maybe [bun](https://bun.sh/) could interface with this library and do faster parsing. 

This project is inspired by [apollo-rs](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs.git).
